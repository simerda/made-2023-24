The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190
economies. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1â€“190. The rankings are determined by sorting
the aggregate scores (formerly called distance to frontier) on 10 topics, each consisting of several indicators,
giving equal weight to each topic.
