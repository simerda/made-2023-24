# Project Plan

## Title
Housing prices in relation to ease of obtaining a construction permit

## Main Question

1. Do housing prices correlate with the ease/difficulty of obtaining a construction permit?

## Description

In the past decade, housing prices in the EU and elsewhere have been rising steadily making it increasingly difficult for
young people to obtain a property to live in. This can be seen as a state contributing to other issues like
the fertility crisis in Europe, as this can be seen as an objective obstacle to starting a family.

This project aims to analyze relevant data and try to understand whether the difficulty of obtaining
a construction permit may affect property prices and can therefore increase insight into what changes policy-makers
can do in order to make ownership of a property for living more affordable.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: The World Bank - Doing Business
* Metadata URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038564/Doing-Business
* Data URL: https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/DB_CSV.zip
* Data Type: CSV

The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190
economies. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1â€“190. The rankings are determined by sorting
the aggregate scores (formerly called distance to frontier) on 10 topics, each consisting of several indicators,
giving equal weight to each topic.

### Datasource2: OECD.Stat - Analytical house price indicators
* Metadata URL: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/prices/analytical-house-price-indicators_cbcc2905-en
* Data URL: https://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=HOUSE_PRICES&lang=en
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains, in addition to nominal Residential Property Prices Indices (RPPIs), information on real house
prices, rental prices and the ratios of nominal prices to rents and to disposable household income per capita.
