# Project Plan

## Title
Relation between Housing prices and the ease of obtaining a construction permit

## Main Question

1. Do housing prices correlate with the ease/difficulty of obtaining a construction permit?

## Description

In the past decade, housing prices in the EU and elsewhere have been rising steadily making it increasingly difficult for
young people to obtain a property to live in. This can be seen as a state contributing to other issues like
the fertility crisis in Europe, as this can be seen as an objective obstacle to starting a family.

This project aims to analyze relevant data and try to understand whether the difficulty of obtaining
a construction permit may affect property prices and can therefore increase insight into what changes policy-makers
can do in order to make ownership of a property for living more affordable.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: The World Bank - Doing Business

The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190
economies. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1â€“190. The rankings are determined by sorting
the aggregate scores (formerly called distance to frontier) on 10 topics, each consisting of several indicators,
giving equal weight to each topic.
